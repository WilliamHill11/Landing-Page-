# Landing-Page-

// What I Learned:
- Learned to research 
- First time styling buttons
- It was not holding my hands and I was able to figure out things on my own such as placing divs, classes or a certain element in certain section to display exactly what I want it to.
- Using instyle css in html (which helped me style the way I wanted it to)


// What I need to work on:
- Make website more responsive when minimizing 
- Using less margin, because I am guessing more on positioning
